‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions (Localhost with XAMPP)
üîß Before running the project, you need to configure a few files.

1Ô∏è‚É£ db_config.php ‚Äì Located in the /Admin folder
‚úÖ Import the .sql file inside the /DATABASE folder into phpMyAdmin.
‚úÖ Then update the following values in db_config.php:

$db_host = 'localhost';
$db_user = 'root';       // Change if your DB username is different
$db_pass = '';           // Change if your DB has a password
$db_name = 'your_db_name'; // Replace with the imported DB name

2Ô∏è‚É£ essentials.php ‚Äì Also in the /Admin folder
Update the URLs to reflect your local folder name:

define('SITE_URL','http://127.0.0.1/hotelbooking/'); 
define('UPLOAD_IMAGE_PATH', $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/hotelbooking/images/');
üîÅ Replace "hotelbooking" with your actual folder name (e.g., guesthouse-booking) if it's different.
