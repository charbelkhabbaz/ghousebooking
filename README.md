üö´ The project was developed without any frameworks and runs locally using XAMPP, making it a lightweight yet robust solution for small to medium-sized guesthouse businesses.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions (Localhost with XAMPP)

üîß Before running the project, you need to configure a few files.

1Ô∏è‚É£ db_config.php ‚Äì Located in the /Admin folder
‚úÖ Import the .sql file inside the /DATABASE folder into phpMyAdmin.
‚úÖ Then update the following values in db_config.php:

$db_host = 'localhost';
$db_user = 'root';       // Change if your DB username is different
$db_pass = '';           // Change if your DB has a password
$db_name = 'your_db_name'; // Replace with the imported DB name

2Ô∏è‚É£ essentials.php ‚Äì Also in the /Admin folder
Update the URLs to reflect your local folder name:

define('SITE_URL','http://127.0.0.1/ghousebooking/'); 
define('UPLOAD_IMAGE_PATH', $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/ghousebooking/images/');
üîÅ Replace "ghousebooking" with your actual folder name (e.g., guesthouse-booking) if it's different.


3Ô∏è‚É£ sendgrid Configuration (Optional ‚Äì for email verification)
If you're using SendGrid for email verification, update these in essentials.php:

define('SENDGRID_API_KEY',"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE");
define('SENDGRID_EMAIL',"YOUR_EMAIL_HERE");
define('SENDGRID_NAME',"ANY_NAME");

You‚Äôll need to:
Sign up at SendGrid

4Ô∏è‚É£ config_paytm.php ‚Äì (Optional Payment Integration)
